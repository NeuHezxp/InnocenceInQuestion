If an issue occurs when opening the unity project and it says there are compile errors, continue through the error, not in safe mode, and re-import all scripts
When opening projects, an issue may arise where it says the scripts are not connected. If this happens in the project directory in Unity, go to scripts and then reimport all objects to get the scripts to function.
